## Scope

This repo is explicitly an unofficial part of the Stack community. An
official policy would need to be approved by the full Stack team. Such
a policy could then have enforcement that includes excluding people
from repositories, mailing lists, and other official community
resources. I will not conceit to make such decisions unilaterally.

My goal here is different. I am trying to establish some accepted
standards for behavior of the Stack community in general. I am hoping
for this to be broader than just official communication channels. I'm
going to encourage improved communications across all mediums.

But I have no right to demand this of anyone, especially in general
communications. Therefore this repository serves primarily to document
how I believe people should act in the Stack community.

As I have done in the past, I will be available for people to
privately express concerns about the behaviors of others. And while I
will not make unilateral decisions on behalf of the Stack leadership,
I will, as necessary:

* Reach out privately to request changes in behavior
* Publicly request changes in behavior
* Raise the issue with the rest of the Stack leadership and consider a
  more official response

## Code of Conduct

Following the discussion on [issue
#1](https://github.com/snoyberg/stack-coc/issues/1), it does not seem
to be appropriate to use a standard Code of Conduct for this
repository. The reason is that this repository is an unofficial set of
guidelines, reflecting one person's recommendations and offer to
intervene in cases where concerning behavior occurs.

Instead, the Code of Conduct can be stated as:

* Try to keep discussions civil, respectful, and where appropriate
  focused on the technical details. For further details, please see
  the [communications guide](COMMUNICATIONS.md).
* If there is concern about the communications occurring in the Stack
  community, I (Michael Snoyman) am available to privately and
  discretely receive those concerns. I can be contacted at `michael at
  snoyman dot com`.
* There is no official policy of consequences for offending
  behavior. I will strive in general to handle matters with care, and
  prefer corrective recommendations to punitive actions.
* There is inherently some ambiguity in some cases as to whether
  behavior is in fact uncivil or disrespectful. I will attempt personally, and
  request from others, to give participants the benefit of the
  doubt. This benefit of the doubt must be balanced against protecting
  the rights and desires of those participating in discussion with
  them.
* The above creates a fine line to walk, and will require some
  subjective decision making. I apologize in advance if I err in this
  process.
